# Field Agent

Custom stylesheet that supplements (not replaces) the [Visual Studio Code Markdown preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) styles.

Mainly adjusts font sizes and spacing between elements. You'll have to scroll more, but it makes the text easier to scan.

## Usage

Follow the instructions for ["Using your own CSS"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) on the Visual Studio Code docs.
